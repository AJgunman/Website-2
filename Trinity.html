<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is an excellent school in San Antonio Texas. It has
 a wonderful campus with lots of opportunities for students. Trinity promotes both effort and quality on campus 
with each class. This is part of the reason I chose Trinity. The classes here are rigorous and rewarding, each class providing 
its own unique challenges and lessons. 
<br>
</br>

The features that I appreciate most at Trinity are the difficulty and high expectations of the courses and the challenge that they bring, and the
size of the campus. I like the difficulty of the courses here as they force me to push my limits and challenge me to do better and work harder.
I like the small campus size as it allows me to meet up and get to know many of my peers in a way that a larger university simply wouldn't.
<br>
</br>

I chose to attend Trinity for the reasons stated above.
<br>
</br>

I'm currently an economics major here at Trinty because I have an interest in economics and know that it leads to fairly stable
career choices. Here is a link regarding my major:
